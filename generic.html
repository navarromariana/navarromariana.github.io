								<p>Hi, my name is Mariana. First of all, I want to take the time to thank you for visiting my website. I am an Economist and Historian, and I am interested in many things but here I would like to put an emphasis on data analytics and visualizations. I have had the priviledge to work on various types of projects but also with various institutions: from international organizations, to academia, to cultural establishments, to Paralympic national teams. In addition to those experiences, throughout my whole academic path I worked teaching privately (math, violin, English, Spanish, and French), at restaurants, and as an office assistant. Additionally, I have had the enormous privilege of residing in 4 different countries and living curiously in each one of those places. Every experience has allowed me to meet people with completely different paths (artists, screenwriters, fashion stylists, economists, cancer researchers, mothers, chefs, etc.) but also from completely different cultural backgrounds, religions, mentalities, etc. I have had the privilege to listen to their adventures and learn from and share perspectives.</p>
								<p>In general, I consider myself very family-oriented and put an emphasis on meaningful interactions. My favorite sports are swimming and basketball, and I love staying up at night reading a book or listening to loud music while improvising (and maybe failing) recipes.</p>
								<p>During this past year, I have dedicated myself to developing my software and analytics skills but also client relations and communication. Besides creating a space to share in detail my projects and interests (as well as my future endeavors!), I am hoping to connect with different types of people to exchange experiences and interests, collaborate, or just to learn about your projects! Thank you again for your time and please feel free to reach out to chat or to share any book or recipe recommendations you may have!</p>
